1. Running a flask app in python
- Create a project
- create a app.py file
- [optional] frontend
- [alternative] use another name instead of app.py - we would need a custom command to run that code 'flask run' wont work here

2. APIs
- GET, POST - These are just rules or protocols to build APIs
- ENDPOINTS - In this app we can have many endpoints with UNIQUE path (/app/genrate, etc)
- BASE_PATH - Base path is the path where the app runs - its always a combination of host and port - syntax - http://host:port - BASE_PATH

3. API ENDPOINTs - [ http://host:port/path ] 
- genrate
- create a password
- get all passwords
 

firstly we run the command in command prompt we firtly copy the path and then we can use
 command flask run -- password.py run
  then we can hit the apis  and postman is not wroking so we use u=curl command in the command prompt
